            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy-blue mb-4">Proteins: What They Are & What They Do</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Proteins are incredibly diverse and perform a vast array of functions in your body. They are made of smaller units called <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">amino acids</span>, linked together like beads on a string by special connections called <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">peptide bonds</span>.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">They function as:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Muscles:</strong> For movement and strength.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Enzymes:</strong> Speeding up chemical reactions.</li>

                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Hormones:</strong> Sending signals throughout the body.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">shape</span> of a protein is super important – it dictates its job! Fibrous proteins, like those in your hair and nails, provide structure, while globular proteins, like enzymes, are involved in chemical reactions.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong> Your muscles grow stronger with protein intake and exercise! And when you get sick, your body produces antibodies (which are proteins!) to fight off infections.</p>

            <!-- Slide 4: Protein Structure -->
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy-blue mb-4">Protein Structure: Levels of Organization</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Proteins are complex molecules, and their structure is described in four fascinating levels:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Primary Structure:</strong> This is the simplest level – just the linear sequence of amino acids, like letters in a word.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Secondary Structure:</strong> The amino acid chain starts to fold into common shapes, such as <span class="font-semibold">α-helices</span> (like a spiral staircase) and <span class="font-semibold">β-sheets</span> (like a pleated paper fan). These shapes are stabilized by hydrogen bonds.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Tertiary Structure:</strong> The entire 3D folding of a single protein chain, driven by interactions between the "side-chains" of the amino acids. This gives the protein its unique overall shape.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-teal-green">Quaternary Structure:</strong> Some proteins are made of multiple folded protein chains (subunits) that come together to form a larger, functional complex.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Remember, a protein's <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">shape directly affects its function</span>! For example, enzymes need a precise shape to fit their target molecules.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong> Ever used hair straighteners? They work by breaking the hydrogen bonds in keratin (a fibrous protein in your hair), temporarily changing its secondary and tertiary structure, and thus its shape!</p>

            <!-- Slide 5: Enzymes – The Speed Machines -->
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy-blue mb-4">Enzymes – The Speed Machines of Life</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Enzymes are special proteins that act as <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">biological catalysts</span>. This means they dramatically accelerate biochemical reactions without being used up themselves!</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Think of them like tiny, super-efficient machines. Each enzyme is highly <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">specific</span> to a particular molecule it acts upon, called a <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">substrate</span>. This is often described by the <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">lock-and-key model</span>, where only the correct key (substrate) fits the specific lock (enzyme).</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">How do they do it? Enzymes work by <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">lowering the activation energy</span> required for a reaction to occur. This allows reactions to happen quickly and efficiently at normal body temperature, which is crucial for life!</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong> The amylase enzyme in your saliva starts digesting starch the moment you take a bite of bread. Industrial detergents also use enzymes to break down tough stains like proteins and fats on your clothes!</p>

            <!-- Slide 22: ATP – The Energy Currency -->
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy-blue mb-4">ATP – The Energy Currency of Life</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Meet <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)</span>, the most important energy-carrying molecule in your cells! Think of it as the universal "energy currency" that cells use to pay for all their activities.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">ATP is primarily made during <span class="font-semibold">cellular respiration</span> (the breakdown of glucose). When energy is needed, ATP is broken down, releasing a burst of energy that fuels processes like:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Muscle contraction 💪</li>
                <li>Active transport (moving substances across cell membranes)</li>
                <li>Synthesis of new molecules</li>
                <li>Nerve impulse transmission</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong> When you feel fatigued, it often means your body's ATP stores are running low. Conversely, after eating a meal, your body breaks down food to produce ATP, giving you an energy surge!</p>

            <!-- Slide 23: Respiration – Making Energy -->
            <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy-blue mb-4">Respiration – The Energy Factory</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4"><span class="font-semibold text-teal-green"> cellular respiration</span> is the process by which cells break down glucose and other food molecules in the presence of oxygen to release energy (ATP). It's essentially how your body "burns" fuel to power itself.</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The simplified equation for aerobic (with oxygen) respiration is:</p>
            <p class="text-center text-xl font-bold text-teal-green my-4">Glucose + Oxygen → CO₂ + H₂O + Energy (ATP)</p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Most of this amazing energy-making process happens in specialized organelles within your cells called <span class="font-semibold text-teal-green">mitochondria</span>, often called the "powerhouses of the cell."</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Real-Life Application:</strong> Ever noticed how you breathe heavily after intense exercise? That's your body increasing its oxygen intake to fuel more cellular respiration, producing the extra ATP needed for your working muscles!</p>
